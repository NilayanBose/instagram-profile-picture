# Instagram Profile Picture Extraction

I have used python to open and also download Instagram profile pictures as because Instagram does not allow us to open the picture.

## use

Clone the repository and run the ```main.py``` file and enter a valid **username** as input.

## requirements

For running this, you need to have python3 installed in your system.

after that run the command
**pip install -r requirements.txt**

This will install all the necessary libraries required for this.

# BONUS

If you are some one who doesn't want to know how the code is working, and rather you would just want to try the script, then, just go ahed and run the **main.exe** file, and that should just work fine for you.
